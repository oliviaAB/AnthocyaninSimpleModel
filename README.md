# AnthocyaninSimpleModel
Simplified model of anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation pathway.

The R scripts (stored in the `scripts` folder) are to be run in the following order:

- `create_model.R`: generates the `sismonr` model (GRN + in silico individuals), and runs one simulation to check the time-course gene expression (see `output/plot_one_simulation.png`). The model is saved in `output/sismonr_anthocyanin_model.RData`.
- `run_simulations.R`: loads the `sismonr` model generated by the previous script and runs the simulations for the 3,000 individuals. The raw simulation output is saved in `output/simulations.RData`.
- `get_simulated_data.R`: loads the raw simulations output and processes the data to obtain a matrix with 3,000 rows (the observations) and 7 columns (the genes), giving the RNA abundance of the genes across the individuals at the final time-point of the simulation. This matrix is saved in `output/simulated_data.csv`.
